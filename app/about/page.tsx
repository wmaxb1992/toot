                Studio Seven was thoughtfully created by mother-daughter duo Laura and Danijela, whose shared love for Pilates blossomed into something much more. What began as a personal journey, earning their mat and reformer certifications side by side, quickly evolved into a vision for a space where they could share their passion with others.

                With a deep appreciation for health, wellness, and the power of mindful movement, they combined their knowledge and heart to bring Studio Seven to life. Their approach blends modern Pilates techniques with a strong focus on mind-body connection, all within a welcoming and supportive environment.

                Located in Amherstburg, ON, Studio Seven is more than a studio, it's a community where you're encouraged to move with purpose, grow with confidence, and feel truly at home.
